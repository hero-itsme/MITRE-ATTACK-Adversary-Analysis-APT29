Detection and Mitigation Recommendations

Priority Detection Areas
- Authentication logs for brute force and password spraying
- Network traffic analysis for obfuscated C2 communication
- Endpoint monitoring for suspicious process execution

SOC Recommendations
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Monitor failed and successful login patterns
- Inspect outbound network traffic for anomalies
- Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- Conduct regular security awareness training
