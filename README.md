MITRE ATT&CK Adversary Analysis — APT29

Project Overview
This project presents an adversary behavior analysis of the threat group APT29 (Cozy Bear) using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The objective is to understand attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and identify effective detection strategies from a SOC and threat intelligence perspective.

Objectives
- Analyze a real-world threat actor using MITRE ATT&CK
- Map adversary techniques to attack lifecycle stages
- Understand attacker behavior and detection opportunities
- Develop practical Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) skills
